MOTIVATION 

I've been part of the Discord community for over 7 years, moderating servers with thousands of members. In that time, I realized how difficult it was to find a single bot that could handle all the tasks a server needs. I often had to juggle 3â€“4 different bots just to keep everything running smoothly.

That inspired me to create Orion â€” an all-in-one Discord bot that does everything a server and its users could want, making management simpler and more fun.

For me personally, Orion has also been an incredible learning experience. As a beginner in IT, building this bot helped me deepen my knowledge of APIs Integration, SQL, Python structure, and many other programming skills â€” all while creating a tool that can truly benefit communities.

Credits

Orion was built using the following technologies and resources:

([discord.py] (https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api.html)) â€” A powerful Python API wrapper for Discord, which made building Orion possible.

Special thanks to the open-source community for providing tools and libraries that help developers bring their ideas to life.
